# Multimodal RP Detection â€“ CT Radiomics + Surrogate IR Features

This repository contains code for a feasibility study on early detection of radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) using a multimodal AI approach. The proposed framework combines CT-based radiomics with surrogate features extracted from infrared thermographic data.

## Contents
- Synthetic IR thermal sample (PNG)
- Simulated CT-based radiomic feature vector (NumPy)
- Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing, fusion, training, and explainability
- Visual outputs (ROC curve, metrics, SHAP plot)

## Requirements
Install all dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
