# Synthetic Multimodal Dataset for Radiation Pneumonitis Prediction

This dataset contains 10 synthetic samples simulating multimodal features for early RP detection using CT radiomics and surrogate IR thermal features.

- 60 CT radiomic features (ct_f1 to ct_f60)
- 3 thermal features: chest asymmetry, respiratory rate, amplitude variability
- Label: 1 = RP+, 0 = RPâ€“

Note: These samples are artificially generated and intended only for proof-of-concept validation.
